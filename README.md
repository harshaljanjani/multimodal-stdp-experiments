## Eidos

**Eidos** is my attempt to constrain the design of intelligent networks within known biological priors and, hopefully, to attract the attention of polymaths with diverse experiences to make it better. My understanding of computational neuroscience is limited at best, and much of the studying that it took to bring this project to life was done over a very short time horizon, with no one to defer to along the way.

### Why the name Eidos?

I’ve been fascinated with this concept for a long time. Eidos is a Platonic concept of **"the true, perfect form"**, of which we see a mere projection in the objects we perceive in our world.

The name Eidos isn't because this project will ever evolve into the perfect form of intelligence, in fact, **it’s quite the opposite**. It might never even get close to the perfect form that is the human brain. 

For all we know, our attempts at cracking AGI have been futile so far, but that’s the point! **The sheer irony of the name** amuses me because many of our inventions as a species have been in search of the perfect, yet we’ve settled for a much lesser version of "perfect" that still advances our species. Or, if it doesn’t at the moment, it lays the foundation for an invention that will shape our species one day. The time horizons we naturally think in as humans are so short that we often forget to see the bigger picture: to pursue research not for immediate gratification, but for the high schooler walking home from school a hundred years from now, who might, having read our work, spark an idea in someone else’s’ mind that leads to the next breakthrough.

We have never tackled something this perfect before, something that has evolved to shape our world as we see it today, individually running on just 20W of power. How crazy is that? Genuinely, just pause here and think about it. And I have never felt that our understanding of anything has been this "not quite the Eidos."

I’ve been curious about the mind since I was 10 or 11 years old. Nothing has satiated my curiosity so far, not our current view of neuroscience, nor even AI. But maybe an interdisciplinary approach combining current AI, neuroscience, and robotics will lead to "something". Let’s see; who knows. This project however, is rooted, in part, in the “cognition is embodied” view, along with other concepts from developmental psychology, robotics, and program synthesis.

### The “Why” From A Bird's-Eye View

Evolution has shaped our minds over a span of roughly 6 million years, with the modern human mind taking form over the past 100,000 to 300,000 years. It’s needless to say that much of its inner workings have remained an enigma to humankind.

Our attempts to model deep learning began with the perceptron, fundamentally based on our understanding of the neuron (clear inspiration was taken from the soma, dendrites, etc.), but we’ve seen an abrupt shift towards LLMs, which, while a great invention, are continually driving us away from biological inspiration. We must fundamentally change the way we think about the task at hand. To my knowledge, I see multiple ways this problem is being attacked as of October 2025 (these are just a few of the many approaches; I haven’t even mentioned bio-inspired ones, though I’m clearly inspired by many of them too):

1. The **Fei-Fei Li** / **World Labs** conjecture of Spatial Intelligence and the Yann LeCun conjecture of World Models can largely be grouped together.
2. The **François Chollet** / **Ndea** front: Program synthesis, ARC-AGI, continual learning, and meta-learning.
3. The **Figure Robotics** / **Sergey Levine** front: Solving general robotics, but something might come out of it for AI with networks like Helix. Although the focus here isn’t innovation in AI, but applied AI.

Eidos builds on concepts I’ve drawn from all of these, and more, and aims to extend them further through our understanding of neuro-cognitive modeling.

### Why should you contribute?

Even if Eidos doesn’t lead to much, the idea is grounded in biological principles, and it’s a pure, opinionated, curiosity-driven endeavor. If you have experience in computational neuroscience or biology, you would be filling a huge gap in my skillset, and I would be happy to see PRs and issues raised. Even if you’re from core AI like me, I would love to know your ideas on features you’d like added, a direction you’d like to pursue, etc. My email is available on my GitHub page. Feel free to reach out.

Also, most importantly, we only increase compute usage here if we absolutely have to; like if the heavens demanded it and the earth split open in protest. I really like François’s definition of intelligence as low-cost skill acquisition, and I’m sticking to it.
